                <p class="faq-subtitle">The COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people 18 years and older.</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">The COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people 18 years and older, including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind, including auto-immune disorders. These conditions include: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled.<br><br>Keep in mind:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>COVID-19 vaccines are free, even if you are uninsured. If you receive a bill, speak to the person or facility that sent it. If they don’t cancel it, contact 1-800-HHS-TIPS or visit tips.hhs.gov to file a complaint.</li>
                    <li>No social security number or government ID is necessary to get a vaccine. A facility may ask for this information to help confirm that you are uninsured, but you can still get vaccinated even if you can’t provide these items.</li>
                    <li>Everyone age 12 and up is eligible, regardless of immigration status. Vaccination will not affect your status or be shared with immigration agencies.</li>
