                <h2>What are the differences between the vaccines?</h2>
                <p class="faq-subtitle">All currently approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective and reduce your risk of severe illness.</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized for people ages 5 and older. It’s a messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccine and includes two shots spaced 21 days apart. In August 2021, the Pfizer vaccine was fully approved by the FDA. The vaccine is 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 and provides strong protection against serious illness. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is now available to kids ages 5 to 11. It’s being given in a smaller dosage and has been found to provide strong protection for children.<br><br>The Moderna vaccine is authorized for people 18 years and over. It’s also an mRNA vaccine and includes two shots spaced 28 days apart. Clinical trials showed the Moderna vaccine was 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 and provides strong protection against serious illness.<br><br>Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine is authorized for people 18 years and over. It’s a viral vector vaccine and only requires one shot. Clinical trials showed the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 72% effective at preventing COVID-19 and provides strong protection against serious illness. Health officials are closely monitoring all vaccines for safety, including the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.<br><br>Having multiple types of vaccines available is crucial so that vaccination programs can quickly reach as many people as possible.</p>
