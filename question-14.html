                <h2>Should young adults get vaccinated?</h2>
                <p class="faq-subtitle">You should get vaccinated, even if you're young and healthy.</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Not getting vaccinated puts you at much higher risk of severe COVID-19, which can make you seriously sick for a long period of time and possibly cause lasting damage—even if you’re young and healthy. We still don’t know why COVID causes such severe disease in some people, so it’s impossible to predict whether you’ll have a mild or serious case if you are exposed.<br><br>There’s also the added convenience of being vaccinated! You don’t have to quarantine if you’ve been exposed to someone who you later found out was infected with COVID-19. And, if you end up traveling someplace that requires a vaccine, that will already be taken care of. Plus, at the end of the day, you will be protected against the disease, so you won’t have to worry about getting other people sick or causing them to need to quarantine by accident.</p>
