                <h2>Can my child get vaccinated?</h2>
                <p class="faq-subtitle">There are vaccines available for children age 5 and up.</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Widespread vaccination for COVID-19 is a critical tool to best protect everyone, especially those at highest risk, from severe illness and death. People who are fully vaccinated can safely resume many activities that they did prior to the pandemic. Children ages 5 years and older are able to get an age-appropriate dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.<br><br>Although children are at a lower risk of becoming severely ill with COVID-19 compared with adults, children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, get very sick from COVID-19, have both short and long-term health complications from COVID-19, and spread COVID-19 to others.<br><br>Children with underlying medical conditions are more at risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared with children without underlying medical conditions. Children who get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 can also develop serious complications like multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)—a condition where different body parts become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs.</p>
