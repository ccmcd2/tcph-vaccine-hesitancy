                <h2>Is the vaccine safe for my child?</h2>
                <p class="faq-subtitle">COVID-19 vaccines are being monitored for safety with the most comprehensive and intense safety monitoring program in U.S. history.</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">CDC monitors the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines after the vaccines are authorized or approved for use, including the risk of myocarditis in children ages 5 through 11 years.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your child may get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines, including flu vaccine, at the same time.</li>
                    <li>Serious health events after COVID-19 vaccination are rare.</li>
                    <li>Cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination of children ages 12–17 years.  These reactions are rare; in one study, the risk of myocarditis after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech in the week following vaccination was around 54 cases per million doses administered to males ages 12–17 years.</li>
                    <li>A severe allergic reaction, like anaphylaxis, may happen after any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines, but this is rare.</li>
                    <li>Your child cannot get COVID-19 from any COVID-19 vaccine, including the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Learn more about how mRNA vaccines, like the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, work.</li>
                    <li>There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause fertility problems.</li>
