                <p class="faq-subtitle">COVID-19 vaccine researchers had a diverse group of participants in clinical trials.</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Researchers made sure that the trials included adults from many types of backgrounds, races, ethnicities, and geographies. They worked closely with faith leaders, community groups, and health clinics across the United States to reach volunteers from different walks of life.<br><br>Medical experts want to make sure the vaccines work safely and effectively for as many people as possible. People may respond differently to vaccines based on factors like age, gender, and health conditions — so it is important to have a diverse group of participants in clinical trials.<br><br>COVID-19 has hit hard in the Black and Hispanic communities. Historically, these populations haven’t always been included in clinical research. With COVID-19 vaccines researchers made sure volunteers included people of color, as well as people over the age of 65 who are at higher risk of complications from the virus.</p>
